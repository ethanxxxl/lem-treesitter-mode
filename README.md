# lem-treesitter

# todo:

- [x]: implement source fetching and compilation
- [x]: define package with dependencies
- [ ]: figure out how to include cl-treesitter from github? without qlfile?
- [ ]: implement treesitter-mode (or is it an extension of language mode?)
    
# hacking
   

to load this from _within_ lem, put it in "~/common-lisp" (or otherwise make it available to asdf):
then: 
(ql:quickload :lem-treesitter-mode)
